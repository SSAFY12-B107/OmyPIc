            <strong>I just listen to rock and classical music, depending on my mood</strong>, you know, it's like my mood swings and I need something to match it. So, when I'm in the mood for something energetic, I put on some rock music and it's like, wow, it's so alive, you know? The guitars, the drums, it's all so intense and it just gets me pumped up. On the other hand, when I'm feeling more relaxed, I listen to classical music and it's like, um, it's just so soothing, you know? It's like I'm in a warm room, just chillin', and it's all good.

            <strong>Rock music makes me feel alive, and classical music makes me feel sophisticated</strong>, like, you know when you're listening to something and you're just feeling the vibe? That's what rock music does for me, it's like, I don't know, it's just so raw and emotional, you know? Like, when I listen to Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", I just wanna, like, let loose and have fun, you know? And classical music, like Chopin's nocturnes, it's just so beautiful and elegant, it's like, I'm a sophisticated person or something, haha. I mean, I'll even turn off the lights and just listen, it's like, the music is transporting me to another world or something.

            <strong>Nirvana is just amazing, no particular reason why</strong>, I mean, it's just one of those things, you know? Like, their music is just so real, so genuine, it's like, they're not trying to be perfect or anything, they're just being themselves, and that's what I love about it. It's like, the emotions are just pouring out, you know? And when I listen to their songs, I'm like, yeah, this is what being young is all about, you know? It's like, the music is capturing this feeling, this energy, and it's just, um, it's just so cool, you know? So, yeah, Nirvana is just, like, the best, and I don't need any other reason why, haha.
